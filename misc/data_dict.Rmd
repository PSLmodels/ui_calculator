## Computation of Weekly Benefit Amount (`state_thresholds.csv`)

Every state computes benefits using a `rate`, which is the ratio of weekly benefits to 
a measure of prior earnings (`base_wage`). We calculate: 

`wba_formula = base_wage*rate + intercept`

This computation is subject to a maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) benefit amount. 

Scenario | Weekly Benefit Amount
--- | ---
`wba_formula < min` | `min`
`min < wba_formula < max` | `wba_formula`
`wba_formula` > `max` | `max`

The `wage_concept` records how the `base_wage` should be calculated and has five possible values:

`wage_concept` | Value of `base_wage`
--- | --- 
`annual_wage` | annual wages
`hqw` | wages in highest quarter
`2hqw` | wages in two highest quarters
`2fqw` | wages in last two quarters
`ND` | wages in two highest quarters + half wages in third highest quarter

Finally, some states have different benefits schedules depending on whether the income of an applicant is over a particular threshold. This is captured by `inc_thresh`. The `inc_thresh` variable records the minimum income as measured in the `wage_concept` for that row, such that the rules in that row should be applied to calculate benefits.   


## Earnings/ Employment Needed in Base Period to Qualify (`state_eligibility.csv`)
We assume that the base period is the calendar year of 2018. We do this because it matches what we observe in the CPS. This would correspond to the standard base period for an applicant in April, May or June of 2019. The DoL summary document for UI benefit rules says 
“Almost all qualifying earnings are determined using a base period consisting of the first four of the last five completed CQs. A few States use a different base period. In the following states, more recent earnings may be used in an alternative base period under certain conditions: AK, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, GA, HI, ID, IL, IA, KS, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, OH, OK, OR, PR, RI, SC, SD, UT, VT, VA, VI, WA, WV, and WI.”

We include variables which enforce the following conditions. Most states include only some of these conditions in their eligibility checks, so the majority of values in `state_eligibility.csv` are `0`.

Variable | Criterion
--- | --- 
`absolute_base` | minimum total earnings in the base period in dollars
`hqw` | minimum total earnings in the base period, expressed as a multiple of high quarter wages 
`absolute_hqw` | minimum high quarter wage in dollars
`wba` | minimum earnings in the base period, expressed as a multiple of worker’s weekly benefit amount
`num_quarters` | minimum number of quarters with wages
`outside_high_q` | minimum earnings outside high quarter in dollars
`wba_outside_hq` | minimum earnings outside high quarter, expressed as a multiple of the weekly benefit amount
`absolute_2nd_high` | minimum earnings in 2nd highest quarter
`wba_2hqw` | minimum earnings in two highest quarters as a multiple of the weekly benefit amount
`abs_2hqw` | minimum dollar amount in two highest quarters
`hqw_2hqw` | minimum in two highest quarters as multiple of high quarter wages
